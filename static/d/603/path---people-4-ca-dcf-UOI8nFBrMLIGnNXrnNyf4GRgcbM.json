Complete the\nfollowing checklist for all new starters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Do Developers have access to all systems, accounts and equipment</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>before they start?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have new starters been assigned a buddy?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have new starters been introduced to key stakeholders and met with</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>their team?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Have new starters been taken through a product/domain walkthrough?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do Developers have a fully functional dev environment before lunch?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Can Developers draw a high-level architecture by the end of the day?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do Developers write and commit non-trivial code on day one?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do new starters contribute to the onboarding process?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Do new starters feel more excited about Qantas and their role to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>play by the end of the day?</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It is expected our partners build an institutional knowledge about the\nways of work at Qantas and provided to new starters before they start.</p>\n<h2>Learning</h2>\n<p>We use a T-shaped learning strategy at Qantas. We expect a broad\nunderstanding across the technology landscape (horizontal). We also\nexpect Developers to specialise in one or a few technologies or\ntechnical (verticals).</p>\n<p>Developers are part of the greater Qantas community with many\nopportunities to collaborate, learn and mentor with. Some of the\nactivities include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>TechHangar: Monthly forum to share knowledge about interesting</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>technologies, trends, projects, practices, etc available in per\nperson or Skype. Sessions are recorded and stored in the Qantas\nwiki.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Hackathons: Performed quarterly. These are theme-based and we</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>encourage all staff to participate to innovate to build and test\nnew ideas focused on Qantas goals. Cross functional teams can be\nformed to help understand the problem (including\nProduct/UX/Engineering/Support)</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>MeetUps: external and occasionally hosted on campus</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Coding tournaments such as Secure Code Warrior</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Partner conferences</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Offboarding</h2>\n<p>We hate to see people leave, doing it well leaves a lasting impression.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Exit interviews: an exit interview should be given to all team</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>members. This is the opportunity for the person leaving to provide\nfeedback. We encourage one-way advice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Handovers: ensure knowledge, access and contacts are handed over</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Access removal: remove access to all systems, especially those not</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>covered under SSO.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All Software Engineers with access to Qantas systems must inform\nQantas on the Developers offboarding date prior to them leaving.</p>\n<h2>Evangelism</h2>\n<p>Finally, we believe it is the role of every Software Engineer to be\nproud of the work you do and even more so, proud of the team you work\nwith. We believe each individual should evangelise these great efforts\nat MeetUps, conferences, guest blogs and BBQs.</p>\n<p>=</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"People","path":"/people"}},"allNavYaml":{"edges":[{"node":{"title":"Purpose","id":"purpose","items":null}},{"node":{"title":"Conventions Used","id":"conventions","items":null}},{"node":{"title":"Agile","id":"agile","items":[{"id":"bugs","title":"Bugs"},{"id":"confluence","title":"Confluence"},{"id":"jira","title":"Jira"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Principles","id":"principles","items":null}},{"node":{"title":"Standards","id":"standards","items":[{"id":"definitions","title":"Definitions of Done"},{"id":"ready","title":"Definitions of Ready"},{"id":"version-control","title":"Version Control"},{"id":"code-review","title":"Code Review/Pull Requests"},{"id":"design-review","title":"Technical Design Review"},{"id":"code-style","title":"Code Style"},{"id":"design-principles","title":"Design Principles"},{"id":"cloud","title":"Cloud"},{"id":"ci-cd","title":"CI/CD"},{"id":"versioning","title":"Versioning"},{"id":"api-standards","title":"API Standards"},{"id":"logging","title":"Logging"},{"id":"readme","title":"README"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Design Implementations","id":"design-implementations","items":[{"id":"application-info","title":"Application Info"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Security","id":"security","items":[{"id":"secure-code","title":"Secure Code Standards"},{"id":"static-code","title":"Static Code Analysis"},{"id":"software-composition","title":"Software Composition Analysis"},{"id":"credentials","title":"Credentials"},{"id":"security-training","title":"Security training"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Testing","id":"testing","items":[{"id":"test-driven-development","title":"Test-Driven Development"},{"id":"characteristics","title":"Characteristics of a Good Unit Test"},{"id":"test-driven-checklist","title":"Test-Driven Development Checklist"},{"id":"test-data","title":"Test Data"}]}},{"node":{"title":"Operational Excellence","id":"operational-excellence","items":[{"id":"ceremonies","title":"Ceremonies"},{"id":"standups","title":"Stand-ups"},{"id":"guilds","title":"Guilds"}]}},{"node":{"title":"People","id":"people","items":null}},{"node":{"title":"Software Engineering Checklist","id":"software-engineering-checklist","items":null}}]}},"pageContext":{"section":"playbook"}}
